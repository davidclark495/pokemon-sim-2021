UNFINISHED

Goal of this commit: 
+ make Pokemon objects more detailed and easier to create 
- add to / clean-up Pokemon.java's stat-related functions
- add to 			Pokemon.java's battle-related functions
- add an XML file / parser to PokemonList.java

Changes since last commit:
- New Classes
	- PokemonBattleExtensions.java (helpful battle-related math & methods)
	- inner classes in Pokemon.java 
		(PersistentStatBlock, InBattleTempStatBlock, RewardStatBlock)
- Modified Classes
	- Pokemon.java (more to do with StatBlocks, battles, mult. types)
	- Pokemon.StatBlock (broken-up into other blocks, + more in-depth functionality)
- New Files
	- res/AllPokemon.xml (can be read to produce the PokemonList.java data)


To-Do (for this commit, from previous commits):
- Pokemon in PokemonList should start with at least 1 Move

To-Do (for future commits):
- make OptionBlock abstract?
- add support for Effects in PokemonBattleExtensions
- make a Narration class in m_activities

To-Do (carried over from last log):
- in BattleActivity, add a _bag_item_heal OptionBlock
- review design for MVC compliance
	- build a prototype GUI
- review access modifiers / getters & setters (in m_activities)
- review method naming conventions for OptionBlock helper methods
- known problem: OptionBlock.setParam() is called instead of (for ex.) StartBlock.setParam()
	- causes gaps in safety-checking assignment
- develop a way of getting text (i.e. non-menu) input
- standardize certain Options (e.g. BACK)

2021/09/01 - 2021/09/02

Goal of this commit: 
- add functionality to m_bag
	- add HealItem.java, others if appropriate
- add tests to BagTester

Changes since last commit:
- New Classes
	* HealItem
- Modified Classes
	* Bag (the default bag includes potions)
	* BagTester (more tests)
	* BattleActivity (you can now only heal a pokemon using a heal item)



To-Do (for this commit, from previous commits):
- flesh-out BagTester

To-Do (for future commits):
- in BattleActivity, add a _bag_item_heal OptionBlock

To-Do (carried over from last log):
- review design for MVC compliance
	- build a prototype GUI
- review access modifiers / getters & setters (in m_activities)

2021/09/01 - 2021/09/01

Goal of this commit: 
- change how OptionBlocks are defined
  * should be defined as a private class in an Activity; should extend OptionBlock
  * should be able to take parameters (either in OptionBlock or in the extended class) 

Changes since last commit:
- New Classes
  * private OptionBlock-extending classes inside BattleActivity
- Modified Classes
  * OptionBlock, additional "param" functions



To-Do (for this commit, from previous commits):
- finish converting BattleActivity's OptionBlocks into inner classes
  * currently, only StartBlock and _FightBlock have dedicated classes
  * certain features should be added to OptionBlock for inheritance (e.g. initialize())
  * a better solution for establishing connections between blocks (a Dictionary?) would help
- go-over BACK options
  * decision: BACK options return you to the previous menu (not always START)

To-Do (for future commits):
- review design for MVC compliance
	- build a prototype GUI
- review access modifiers / getters & setters
- review method naming conventions for OptionBlock helper methods
- known problem: OptionBlock.setParam() is called instead of (for ex.) StartBlock.setParam()
