Goal of this commit: 
- clean-up BattleActivity, make it scaleable
  * Activity (abs) and BattleActivity should demonstrate proper inheritance
  * OptionBlocks should be implemented as private inner classes extending OptionBlock
  * rearrange project structure, grouping activity-related classes in the same package

Changes since last commit:
- New Classes
  * private OptionBlock-extending classes inside BattleActivity
- Modified Classes
  * GameModel.java	(player's bag is now set-up here)
  * Player.java		(player now starts with an empty bag, previously started with a basic bag)

To-Do (for future commits):
- go-over BACK options
  * should they take you to the previous menu? to the start menu?
  * make a decision + ensure compliance
- develop a way of getting text (i.e. non-menu) input
- finish converting BattleActivity's OptionBlocks into inner classes
  * currently, only StartBlock and _FightBlock have dedicated classes
  * certain features should be added to OptionBlock for inheritance (e.g. initialize())
  * a better solution for establishing connections between blocks (a Dictionary?) would help

To-Do (carried over from last log):
- standardize certain Options (e.g. BACK)
- Pokemon in PokemonList should start with at least 1 Move
- flesh-out BagTester

2021/08/22 - 2021/08/30

Goal of this commit: 
- finish BattleActivity + necessary model updates
  * BattleActivity + ActivityDemo should be able to navigate an Activity
    (i.e. take input, display options, etc.)
  * BattleActivity doesn't need to actually change the model yet (that can be done later)
+ as of 08/30/21, the goal appears to be met

Changes since last commit:
- New Classes
  * Bag, Item, Pokeball
  * Pokemon.StatBlock (unfinished)
- Modified Classes
  * Trainer (added getParty())
  * Pokemon (works with StatBlock)
  * PokemonList (new Pokemon)

To-Do (for future commits):
- standardize certain Options (e.g. BACK)
- Pokemon in PokemonList should start with at least 1 Move
- clean-up Activity, put certain methods / objects in the abstract version
- flesh-out BagTester
