Goal of this commit: 
- change how OptionBlocks are defined
  * should be defined as a private class in an Activity; should extend OptionBlock
  * should be able to take parameters (either in OptionBlock or in the extended class) 

Changes since last commit:
- New Classes
  * private OptionBlock-extending classes inside BattleActivity
- Modified Classes
  * OptionBlock, additional "param" functions



To-Do (for this commit, from previous commits):
- finish converting BattleActivity's OptionBlocks into inner classes
  * currently, only StartBlock and _FightBlock have dedicated classes
  * certain features should be added to OptionBlock for inheritance (e.g. initialize())
  * a better solution for establishing connections between blocks (a Dictionary?) would help
- go-over BACK options
  * decision: BACK options return you to the previous menu (not always START)

To-Do (for future commits):
- review design for MVC compliance
	- build a prototype GUI
- review access modifiers / getters & setters
- review method naming conventions for OptionBlock helper methods
- known problem: OptionBlock.setParam() is called instead of (for ex.) StartBlock.setParam()
	- causes gaps in safety-checking assignment

To-Do (carried over from last log):
- develop a way of getting text (i.e. non-menu) input
- standardize certain Options (e.g. BACK)
- Pokemon in PokemonList should start with at least 1 Move
- flesh-out BagTester
